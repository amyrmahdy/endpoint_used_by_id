1. Gather all data which includes an ID in INPUT field. Knowing anything about OUTPUT field is not neccessary.
2. Develope a solution for Data Mart which fits this problem. E.g. composite key can be (jalalidate + id), so per jalalidate and id there is a list of endpoint which took that specific id as input. But it's not the only solution which exists. 
3. Develope an API using FastAPI.
4. Maintenance and Support.
